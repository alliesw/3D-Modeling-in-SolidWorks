# Solid_Works_Projects

Personal Project: Create a 3D-printable design of a N99(FFP3) mask in SolidWorks 

Convert SolidWorks files to STL files for direct 3D-print 
(conversion is done within solidworks software)

FOR 3D PRINTING
Materials: 
1. Filter/Mask: Polypropelene (PP Fiber) 
2. Valve:  Polypropelene (PP Fiber) 
3. Staples: Steel (to secure headband)
4. Nose clip: metal, PP
5. Sealing lip: synthetic foam (for comfort) 
6. 4-point headband attachment: synthetic latex/Polyisoprene

Note:
-- To imitate the FFP3 flat-fold mask:
1. use textile for the Headband material instead of rubber/latex 
2. Add Hydrophobic coating
